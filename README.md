# The Starlight Hotel

## A game written using React + Redux

This game was created as a capstone project as part of my Integrated Computer Science degree.
An overview of the storyline planned for the game is available [here](/storylinePlan.txt).
The published version is hosted on Netlify and is available to play [here](https://starlight-hotel.netlify.app/).
You may also fork this repository to run it on your machine using `npm start` in the project directory to run the app in development mode.
