The Starlight Hotel Plot overview

- The player starts the game as a new hire named Kira at the Starlight Hotel laundry room, a fancy beachside Hotel.
- Kira starts work, and soon meets a coworker named Cera who seems a bit odd, but friendly.
- Kira overhears a conversation between Cera and her friend Skipper (a houseman) where Cera warns him to be careful now that he's been assigned 
a house. Skipper jokingly says he'll back out as soon as he starts hoarding linens and Cera makes a comment about not
wanting to have to fight him over duvets.
- While working and interacting with the environment, Kira discovers that the king duvets are a common point of tension
in the laundry room with the housemen always wanting more and sometimes stealing them out of each others bins.
- One day, Cera pulls Kira behind the racks of tablecloths as two men in blue shirts with sunglasses enter the laundry room. Cera
calls them the "Men in Blue" and says they are not to be trusted. She has Kira help her move some king duvets that she had been
storing under the folding counter to a better hiding spot to keep the Men in Blue from finding them.
- Cera recruits Kira as her "sidekick" from that point forward and tells her that she really goes by "Linen Lady"
    - Points of the mystery that have already been uncovered by Linen Lady are slowly revealed through various interactions.
- Linen Lady begins wearing a "cape" at work, made of one of the white and yellow striped beach towels. She gives Kira a washcloth
cape to wear as well, and dubs her "Material Girl".
- Skipper begins acting strange, and Linen Lady sends Kira on quests to gather information. (The quests will increasingly rely on 
the player to complete by using their knowledge and skillfuly interacting with coworkers/solving puzzles)
    - (Ideally, part of the reason Kira is willing to help is to help save Skipper, since she otherwise would just 
    find the situation odd and would realistically just quit her job)
- Through exploring, interacting with coworkers, and solving puzzles, Kira will discover that the hotel has a strange life-force behind it 
that is driven by the housemen (who she discovers are half-house, half-men), who collect linens to feed energy to this force. She will discover 
that this force is Rick the MEGABEAST, who lives under the golf course pond. The Men in
Blue are agents who observe the employees behavior to report back to this force as well. The hotel is growing larger, and could consume
the entire city if not stopped. Linen Lady and Material Girl (with the help of some unexpected allies) will have to figure out how
to stop Rick the MEGABEAST before the Starlight Hotel grows too large to stop.
