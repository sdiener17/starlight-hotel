  generalOverviewText1: `This game came about from an experience I had working in a hotel laundry
  room one summer with a friend. We had fun coming up with wild
  conspiracies and mysteries while on the job, and I thought it could be a
  fun idea for a game.`,
  generalOverviewText2: `The player starts out as a new hire at the Starlight Hotel named Kira
  who, after meeting a few coworkers, starts to realize that there's more
  to this hotel than meets the eye. Through interacting with coworkers and
  exploring the various hotel areas, the player will uncover the secrets
  hidden the shiny, beachside hotel.`,
  projectPurposeText1: `Hi, I'm Sarah! Thanks for checking out my game! There's not much to it at the moment, but I have plans to continue working on it, so feel free to read more about it below. I created this game as a capstone project for the completion of my degree in Integrated Computer Science at Kansas State University. My degree concentration is in English (emphasis writing), which led me to developing a story-based game.`,
  technicalDetailsText1: `This site is hosted on Netlify and was created using React, a JavaScript library for web development. Additionally, Redux is used for state management and several other packages were used to aid with the development process.`,
  technicalDetailsText2: `I originally planned to use Tiled to create a map for the game, but this proved to be difficult without learning to use more advanced libraries. I also originally used the domain-specific scripting language, Ink, to create the game logic, but I realized early on that it didn't fit my plans for this project as well as previously thought, so I decided not to use it.`,

  whatILearnedText1: `Despite not having many working pieces by the end of the semester, I learned a great deal from my time spent on this project and I feel that I was able to use my previous programming experiences from various classes and internships to help me in the development process.`,
  skillsUsedText1: `Prior web development experience from two summer internships.`,
  skillsUsedText2: `Object-oriented thinking (despite the fact that this project is not strictly object-oriented) to help organize code into classes/components for better readability, reusability, and extensibility.`,
  skillsUsedText3: `Experience with debugging/troubleshooting code from all of my previous computer science classes and internships. This was especially helpful when learning how to use new technologies or in using functional components in a different way than I'm used to.`,
  challengesEncounteredText1: `I initially wanted to include a 2d game map that the player could move around on and interact with. I had many issues getting the map to render on my React application and determined that it would take more advanced libraries and/or greater knowledge in game rendering to accomplish this than what I was able to do in a semester-long project, leading me to design the game without a map.`,
  challengesEncounteredText2: `Despite having a good amount of experience with React, I have never developed a game before, so it took a bit of trial and error to figure out the best way to create certain aspects of the game. Because of this, I wasn't able to plan the game structure out well beforehand, and instead would often write code that I later scrapped due to it being inefficient, not reusable, and not very readable.`,
